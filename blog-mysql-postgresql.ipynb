        "Jupyter instructions: Most of the codes in this notebook are written in SQL and are meant to be run in MySQL or PostgreSQL server applications. That said, there is a small chance you can find relevant kernels [here](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this post, we will learn how to use SQL to query a plant disease dataset loaded both as [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) databases. We will also compare the capabilities of each database in general and specific to our example task.\n",

        "## MySQL vs PostgreSQL - General Comparison\n",
        "\n",
        "**SQL Compliance**\n",
        "- PostgreSQL is more SQL compliant and supports more advanced SQL features like window functions, CTEs, INTERSECT, etc.\n",
        "- MySQL has some deviations from SQL standards but has been improving compliance in recent versions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Performance**\n",
        "- MySQL is known to perform better for read-heavy workloads, which is why it's popular for web applications. It's faster for simple read queries.\n",
        "- PostgreSQL performs better for complex queries, large datasets, and read-write workloads. It has a more sophisticated query optimizer.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Replication**\n",
        "- MySQL has built-in master-slave replication and some clustering solutions, but may require 3rd party tools for more advanced setups.\n",
        "- PostgreSQL has built-in synchronous replication which makes it easier to setup high availability.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Concurrency**\n",
        "- PostgreSQL handles concurrency better with its Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) architecture. Readers don't block writers.\n",
        "- MySQL traditionally used table-level locking but has improved with row-level locking in recent versions. Still, it doesn't handle high concurrency as well as PostgreSQL.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Full Text Search**\n",
        "- PostgreSQL has built-in full text search capabilities.\n",
        "- MySQL has full text search but it requires special setup and configuration.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Types**\n",
        "- PostgreSQL supports a wider range of data types including native support for arrays, hstore (key-value pairs), and advanced geometric/spatial types.\n",
        "- MySQL has a more limited set of data types. It has spatial extensions but not as advanced as PostGIS.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Extensibility**\n",
        "- PostgreSQL is highly extensible. You can create custom data types, operators, index types, etc. Popular extensions include PostGIS, pg_trgm, hstore.\n",
        "- MySQL is less extensible. It allows user-defined functions but not new data types or operators.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Stored Procedures**\n",
        "- Both support stored procedures but PostgreSQL allows them to be written in multiple languages (PL/pgSQL, PL/Python, PL/Perl, etc.)\n",
        "- MySQL stored procedures are written in SQL with some extensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Licensing**\n",
        "- Both are open source but MySQL has a dual licensing model - GPL open source and commercial. It's owned by Oracle.\n",
        "- PostgreSQL is fully open source under the permissive PostgreSQL license. Owned by a non-profit.\n",

        "If there is a geospatial component to the data, like field locations, PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension would provide advanced capabilities for geospatial indexing and queries that MySQL cannot match.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Machine Learning**  \n",

        "- Better handling of concurrency for write workloads\n",
